  cardDescriptions:
  - Why did the jester become a gardener? He wanted to grow some pun-kins!
  - Why did the peasant bring a pencil to the king's court? To draw his sword!
  - Why did the tomato turn red? Because it saw the salad dressing!
  - My favourite childhood memory was building sand castles with my grandad, until
    my mom took the ashes away.
  - The castle chef overcooked the meat of today's lunch, but that's Ok, we all make
    Miss-stakes.
  - My liege, about the fruit theif  captured this afternoon, you need to let that
    man-go.
